As Shakespeare
once said
To be or not to be
that is the question
Or is it not
Is it something else
is it that he wrote it
twice?
To be or not to be
that is the question
or is it not
I really can't be sure
Can you?
As Michaelangelo
Once said
that is the question
Even so
To be or not to be
That is the question
